    <h1>FJAP Industries Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 31, 2026</p>
    <p>This global privacy policy applies to all mobile and web applications developed by FJAP Industries (“we”, “us”, “our”). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <p>We collect information you voluntarily provide when you interact with our apps, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contact information (e.g., email address when you contact support)</li>
      <li>Feedback or survey responses</li>
      <li>Data you enter within the app for functionality (e.g., job data in Loadcounter)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <p>When you use our apps, we may automatically collect certain information about your device and usage, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device model and operating system</li>
      <li>App version</li>
      <li>Usage data (e.g., pages/screens viewed, features used)</li>
      <li>Crash and performance data</li>
      <li>IP address and approximate location inferred from it</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Location Data</h3>
    <p>Certain apps (e.g., Loadcounter) may collect precise location information if you grant permission. This is used only for core functionality (geofencing and tracking) and is not stored externally unless you explicitly export or share this data yourself.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Names, usernames, or contact lists (unless voluntarily provided)</li>
      <li>Authentication credentials or passwords</li>
      <li>Payment card/banking information (handled exclusively by app stores/third‑party providers)</li>
      <li>Personal files (e.g., photos, documents) beyond what you intentionally open in the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain app features and functionality</li>
      <li>To improve and enhance app performance and usability</li>
      <li>To respond to your support requests and communicate with you</li>
      <li>To monitor usage patterns and diagnose technical issues</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and protect our rights</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>Our apps do not rely on traditional cookies in native mobile environments. In web‑based interfaces, we may use cookies or similar technologies to remember preferences and analyze usage. You can typically control cookies through your browser settings.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent personal information. We may share information with trusted third‑party service providers who help us deliver functionality and analyze usage, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crash reporting and analytics providers</li>
      <li>Cloud services used by the app stores</li>
      <li>Support system providers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Data may also be disclosed if required by law or to protect our rights.</p>

    <h2>5. Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our apps may integrate with third‑party services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase, Maps) to provide functionality and performance monitoring. Those services may collect their own data as required by their privacy policies. We do not have control over their independent data practices.</p>

    <h2>6. Location and Geofencing</h2>
    <p>For apps with geolocation features (e.g., Loadcounter):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Precise location data may be collected only with your explicit permission</li>
      <li>You may revoke location permissions at any time via system settings</li>
      <li>If location access is revoked, relevant app features may be disabled</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your information only as long as needed to provide app services and comply with legal obligations. Local app data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app. Logs and analytics are periodically purged according to our internal retention policies.</p>

    <h2>8. User Rights</h2>
    <p>Subject to applicable law, you may have rights including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to the data we hold about you</li>
      <li>Correction of inaccurate information</li>
      <li>Deletion of your personal data</li>
      <li>Restriction of processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at the address below.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data. However, no system can be completely secure. You agree that we are not responsible for unauthorized access unless caused by our violation of applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our apps are not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under that age. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us for deletion.</p>

    <h2>11. International Users</h2>
    <p>Our services are provided globally. By using our apps, you agree to the transfer and processing of information in jurisdictions where we operate. Local laws may differ from your home country’s laws. You are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted here with a revised effective date. Your continued use of our apps constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
